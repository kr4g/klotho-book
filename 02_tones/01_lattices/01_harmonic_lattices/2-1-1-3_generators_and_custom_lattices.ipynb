    "\n",
    "1. **Generator bases** let us re-axis the lattice with any set of intervals we like—as long as the basis matrix is ***unimodular*** ($\\det(A) = \\pm 1$). A valid generator set produces the exact same infinite set of ratios as the primes—they're just arranged and connected differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The basis matrix** encodes each generator as a monzo (column vector). Its determinant tells us whether the generators form a valid, reversible basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordinate conversion** between prime and generator bases is straightforward linear algebra: multiply by the inverse basis matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditioning** distinguishes good bases from awkward ones: even among unimodular bases, some produce cleaner, smaller coordinates than others. Unimodularity is necessary but not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Same path, different generators**: identical lattice coordinates produce entirely different music depending on the generator basis. The geometry is preserved but the harmonic content changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Structure re-interpretation**: scale embeddings can be transplanted into lattices with different generators, producing new scales that share the same geometric fingerprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future notebooks, we'll use these lattice structures for more sophisticated compositional applications—Combination Product Sets, pattern matching on lattice faces, and higher-dimensional navigation."
