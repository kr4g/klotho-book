    "Every lattice we've explored in this notebook has one thing in common: the origin is always the ***unison***—the ratio $\\frac{1}{1}$. No matter the generators, the dimensionality, or the resolution, there's always this gravitational center. Everything radiates outward from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been taking this for granted, but it's not a given. Not all lattice-like structures have a tonal center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll look at a special type of lattice formalization created by Erv Wilson called ***Combination Product Sets*** (**CPS**). These structures are even more abstract: they have no unison, no origin, no hierarchy. There is no \"gravity.\""

    "Here's what we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generator bases** let us re-axis the lattice with any set of intervals we like—as long as the basis matrix is ***unimodular*** ($\\det(A) = \\pm 1$). A valid generator set produces the exact same infinite set of ratios as the primes—they're just arranged and connected differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The basis matrix** encodes each generator as a monzo (column vector). Its determinant tells us whether the generators form a valid, reversible basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordinate conversion** between prime and generator bases is straightforward linear algebra: multiply by the inverse basis matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditioning** distinguishes good bases from awkward ones: even among unimodular bases, some produce cleaner, smaller coordinates than others. Unimodularity is necessary but not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Same path, different generators**: identical lattice coordinates produce entirely different music depending on the generator basis. The geometry is preserved but the harmonic content changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Structure re-interpretation**: scale embeddings can be transplanted into lattices with different generators, producing new scales that share the same geometric fingerprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future notebooks, we'll use these lattice structures for more sophisticated compositional applications—Combination Product Sets, pattern matching on lattice faces, and higher-dimensional navigation."
