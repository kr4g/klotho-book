# Klotho Tutorials

Welcome to the Klotho tutorial series. These tutorials cover the theory and practice of computer-assisted composition using the Klotho toolkit, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced techniques.

## How to use this site

Most pages are fully readable without running anything — code outputs, plots, and audio playback are all pre-rendered.

For tutorials with **interactive widgets** (dropdowns, explorers), click the **power button** at the top of the page to activate a live Python kernel via Binder. This may take a moment to start.

## Suggested reading path

1. **General** — Module overview and design philosophy
2. **Time** — Rhythm trees, temporal units, and compositional operations
3. **Tones** — Lattice-based pitch systems, combination product sets, and EDO frameworks

Use the sidebar to navigate, or click **Next** at the bottom of each page to proceed in order.
